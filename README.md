# Fitness Class Bot

Actually useful filters for finding fitness group classes that fit your requirements.

## Vision

Many gyms offer group activities, such as pilates or body toning. Sometimes there are too many classes to choose from and you're left wondering what would make sense in your situation. Filters often don't provide much information. I already know there's pilates. What I want to know is why should I choose pilates over let's say yoga? This is where the NLP chatbot based fitness-class-bot comes in and helps you out.

Example: *I want to strengthen my core*. Possible answer: *pilates, body toning*
